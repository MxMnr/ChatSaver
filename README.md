# ChatSaver
Created by [@MxMnr](http://github.com/mxmnr)

A chrome browser extension that gives you the power to export entire ChatGPT conversations as text files for saving, sharing and collaborating.

## Problem
Currently there is no data-secure method or tool for extracting the text of a ChatGPT conversation — diminishing the ability for teams and individuals to save, share and collaborate based on text and insights generated from prompt engineering efforts.
- Existing tools put sensitive data, prompt I.P., and R&D at risk of being shared publicly
- No ability to extract prompts to create team prompt templates and repeatable workflows
- No ability to aggregate effective prompts

## How it works:
- Checks if the current webpage is chat.openai.com
- If true, displays a “Save Chat” button
- Click "Save Chat", extracts the text from the current conversation and opens new tab with a download link
- Click "Download", automatically downloads a text file with full chat to your device

## Installation
1. Download the ChatSaver file folder
2. Unzip the file (if it isn’t already)
3. Open Chrome, Brave or Arc (or other Chrome-extension-friendly browser)
4. Open the Extension Manager (three dot menu in top right of browser window)
5. Turn on “Developer Mode”
6. Click action to “Load Unpacked”
7.Choose ChatSaver folder and click to upload
8. Refresh any chats you have open and the extension should begin working
